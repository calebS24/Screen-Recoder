Build a Screen Recorder using Python

Introduction:
This project shows a clear idea of how easy it is to make a screen recorder software. The Screen recorder software and apps are very helpful for our classes, to keep a note of something important, or to keep any memories handy. Well, our project is going to teach us the necessary libraries, proposed modules, references, and screenshots to understand how this code actually works.

Libraries:
1.	Pillow
2.	Numpy
3.	Opencv-contrib-python
4.	Pywin32
5.	ImageGrab
6.	GetSystemMetrics
7.	DateTime

Proposed Modules: 
Current date and time, taking recorded video as .mp4 files and saving in our desired folder, taking screen resolution with pixels w.r.t frame rates per second and time duration of the video, conversion of BGR color format to RGB color format as OpenCV uses BGR as it default condition.
